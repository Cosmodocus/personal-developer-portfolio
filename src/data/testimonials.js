    testimonial:
      "I've had the opportunity to manage Reza during his internship at Radical AI. He has demonstrated exceptional skills in front-end development, particularly working with React.js (NextJS), JavaScript, and other web development technologies building re-usable and scalable user interface components. As the team lead in a squad of interns, Reza has shown great leadership and significantly contributed to the Kai Tools History feature which they worked on in our open-source repository. His progress updates were always precise, and he communicated effectively during all our stand-ups as well as asynchronously. Reza's code contributions seamlessly integrated into the existing codebase, following established styles and patterns with ease and he exhibited a strong work ethic, a positive attitude, and a keen willingness to learn. I recommend Reza for any front-end software engineering role and believe he will be a great addition to any software development team.",
